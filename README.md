# Trijam 114 submission

This is my Trijam 114 submission!

11:57pm Thursday night for me, voting ends in ~2 hours. Looks like the theme is gonna be...

## Smoke without fire

Ideas if it is:
- A game where you have to try and start a fire but it's impossible.
- Lighting cigarettes with a stove element.
- Rubbing sticks together but only to a certain point, if you rub too quickly it starts a fire and you get game over.
- A "smokethrower" where you have to make smokescreens.
- Character is leaf man and you have to prevent him catching fire.
